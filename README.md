## Development Workflow

Checkout `master` and update it.

```bash
git checkout 'master'
git pull
```

### Create a feature branch

```bash
# -b is the flag that will create the branch
git checkout -b 'my-branch-name'
```

### Commit your changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Add your commit message'
```

### Push to the remote branch (Github in our case)

```bash
git push origin 'my-branch-name'
```

Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) for review. Once your PR is reviewed, merge ur 'branch' into the 'master' branch.
